TEST:
    performance
        to_json is INSANELY SLOW

    create an item, use it in recent, dashboard, alert and nia rules, then delete it and check accordingly

    proxy rules pushing

HIGH PRIORITY:

    distributed workers, same as shards (daniele)

    evidence grid methods (alor)
    offline import (alor)

    Crawler for geo

    Alerting daemon (worker)

    export logs: all, blotter, filters...

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

    complete the worker decoding (daniele)
	- audio
	- geolocation

    rename proxy -> injector

    get_accessible should be faster

    Forwarder (worker)

    default keystore for android & applet

LOW PRIORITY:

    get time via http (collector)

    dongle dll (naga)

    rubyencoder for 1.9.3 does NOT exist yet... :(

    mongo authentication

    regsrv32 capicom.dll  (or run ruby as system)

    bundle config build.mysql2 --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt
    gem install mysql2 --platform=ruby -- --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt

FUTURE:

    jruby?

    correlation hooks
