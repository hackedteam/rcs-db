======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)

======================================
IDEAS:

    global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)
