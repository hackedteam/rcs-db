TODO 9.2.x

  investigate .net installation... does it require reboot?

  TRY:
    caching slow query. try to cache already jsonized list of items and similar

  IMPLEMENT:

    export to connector [OK] (needs some config from the console...)

    soldier (with simplified config)

    new blacklist format
      0|Online|B/S|32|Kaspersky

    support for exploit pack file with VPS address (serving only exploits)

    create as target (from automatic entities) [OK] (needs button in console)

    crypto-currency dissector
      - implement the evidence format
      - dissector in sbdb [ok]
      - check compilation under windows [ok]
      - remove temporart files __db*

    tests for all the builds of different platforms (win, osx, android...)
      - build every kind of method (silent, scout, melted, cooked, wap, qrcode...)
      - test the upgrade process (check that files are put in queue)
      - create a new rake spec:build:all and aliases for spec:build:platform [ok]

    protect the code of the rcs-common gem (include the rgloader dir in the gem)
      - modify the rake build command

    filter links by type (e.g. I want to see only skype links). We can change the format of the info attribute..

  IDEAS:
    message quque on entities
      - sort of "inbox" for each entity on what the system performs on it
        the customer can review the messages and acknowledge them

    advanced multi operation search

======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    automatic discovery (and thus suggestion) of groups (communities)

    map api request statistics

    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)

    RUBY 2.0.0 ON WINDOWS depends on this:
      - http_parsers 0.5.3 needs this file https://github.com/johanneswuerbach/http_parser.rb_2.0_precompiled
      - check if new version has it
      - check that websocket dependencies have the correct version

======================================
IDEAS:

    global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)
