TODO 8.3.0:

    why ruby-p327 is so slow? (only on Win2003)

    failed backup (mongodump 2.2 error look for fix from mongo)

    resolve position!!!

    checksum on license in db

    parse screenshot for config of scout

    target profiles

    backup aggregated data for entities

    entities:
      - manual (confirmed)
      - automatic (confirmed / unconfirmed)
      - ghost (not shown)

    aggregates:


    flows:
      - message
      - call


TODO FUTURE:

    differentiate between input/output connectors:
        - xml format
        - implement transport layers:
        - proprietary for read-only db
        - sftp

    correlation:
        chat peer not as string but array
        target records (schedario)
        global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)
        inter-target query

======================================

    mongo authentication

    upgrade to mongoid 3.0.x

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)
      - factory (direct mongo query)
      - operation (direct mongo query)
      - search (direct mongo query)
      - target (direct mongo query, move has too much logic)
