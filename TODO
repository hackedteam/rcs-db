TODO 8.3.0:

    why ruby-p286 is so slow? (mongo ruby driver?) (only on win2003?)

    failed backup (mongodump 2.2 error look for fix from mongo)

    migrate user permissions

    license for upload & execute

    factory to the operation level
      - new instances create new targets

    target profiles


TODO FUTURE:

    differentiate between input/output connectors:
        - xml format
        - implement transport layers:
        - proprietary for read-only db
        - sftp

    correlation:
        chat peer not as string but array
        target records (schedario)
        global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)
        inter-target query

======================================

    mongo authentication

    upgrade to mongoid 3.0.x

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)
      - factory (direct mongo query)
      - operation (direct mongo query)
      - search (direct mongo query)
      - target (direct mongo query, move has too much logic)
