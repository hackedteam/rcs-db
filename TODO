    alerts on link creation

    Realtime:
      - link between entities already created (on new aggregate)

    Batch:
      - identity relation if two entities have the same handles


    aggregates for places (positioner algorithm)

    create entity form most_contacted
    associate entity from most_contacted

    flows:
      - message
      - call

     export entities data

TODO FUTURE:

    differentiate between input/output connectors:
        - xml format
        - implement transport layers:
        - proprietary for read-only db
        - sftp

    correlation:
        global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)
