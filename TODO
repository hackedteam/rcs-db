TEST:
    create an item, use it in recent, dashboard, alert and nia rules, then delete it and check accordingly

    create an agent, sync, delete it and check the evidence destroy process (should drop evidences and gridfs)

    check if after deletion the evidences (and grid) are actually deleted

HIGH PRIORITY:

    fix PATH mangling during installation

    export filesystem

    worker decoding (daniele):
        - call
        - mic
        - calendar
        - mail
	- addressbook

    link alerts to store evidence

    websocket per push delle istanze

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

    upgrade for nia

    FFI per dongle dll

LOW PRIORITY:

    remove the debug integrity for license

    /usr/bin/mongodb --config $PATH-TO-CONFIG --shutdown

    mongo logRotate  & append to log

    mongo compact after deletion

    mongo authentication

    is vcredist needed ?


FUTURE:

    Forwarder (worker)
