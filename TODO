TODO 9.0.0

    upgrade to ruby 1.9.3-p392 on windows

    --

  FIX:
    check "end of file reaced" from mongoid
    try to implement "retry" on mongoid queries
    check threads waiting on queued collection: alert, push  (topac)


  IMPLEMENT:
    statistic analyzer (alor)
      automatic detection of home / office (needs timezone for each entity)
      automatic entities from "very" most contacted

    export intellingece data (topac)
      entities data
      graph data

    aggregation for URL
      aggregate on domain only (think if the pages have to be saved in the "info" field")
      manual creation of entities of type "virtual place" (site url)
      use the handles of "virtual place" to add urls to it
      link targets to "virtual place" if the target visits that url (complete url with page)


    refactor the connectors to use queue and export from separate process
      - xml export
      - sync with "archive" rcs installation

    link_position_entities_spec => test alerts when link or entities are created

  TRY:
    hash index for sharding (topac - on branch 9.0.x)



======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)


======================================
