TEST:
    performance

    create an item, use it in recent, dashboard, alert and nia rules, then delete it and check accordingly

    injector rules pushing

    create an agent, sync, delete it and check the evidence destroy process (should drop evidences and gridfs)

    check if after deletion the evidences (and grid) are actually deleted

    sms wap send

    export logs: all, blotter, with filters, filesystem...

    check the TODOs in the code...


LOW PRIORITY:
