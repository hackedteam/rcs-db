  TRY:
    caching slow query. try to cache already jsonized list of items and similar

  IMPLEMENT:

    Password enforcement for users
      - strong password required (10 chars + [a-zA-Z0-9]) - (change even in the console form)
      - passwords expire every 3 months
      - alerts on every login starting from 15 days before expiry (message push in console)
      - expired account get a custom "expired password" error on login
      - hidden config.yaml flag to not expire passwords (for us on devel machines)

    PUSH messages send the whole object (like dashboard)

    fix usb building zip creation (uses too much ram in f.read)

    crypto-currency dissector
      - support for multibit and armory wallets

    filter links by type (e.g. I want to see only skype links). We can change the format of the info attribute..

TODO: 9.3.0

    Mongoid refactoring
      - check if mongoid 4 is stable
      - migrate to mongoid 4
      - get rid of old ruby-mongo-driver
      - use the new moped/gridfs
      - check if the connection pooling helps resolving the "get_stucked" problem

    archive mode able to receive from multiple systems

    automatic discovery (and thus suggestion) of groups (communities)
    calculate "centrality" on entities
    calculate "weight" on entities

======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    message quque on entities
      - sort of "inbox" for each entity on what the system performs on it
        the customer can review the messages and acknowledge them

    advanced multi operation search

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)
