TEST:
    performance

    create an item, use it in recent, dashboard, alert and nia rules, then delete it and check accordingly

    injector rules pushing

    create an agent, sync, delete it and check the evidence destroy process (should drop evidences and gridfs)

HIGH PRIORITY:

    add action in nssm to delete lock files, in case of restart after a crash

    check the TODOs in the code...

    dont' send config to backdoor too old (7.x)

    take the hostname of the shards and not use the "auto" ip discovery

    Forwarder (worker)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

    worker decoding (daniele):
        - call
        - mic
        - calendar
        - mail
        - file

    get_accessible should be faster

    sms wap send

    export logs: all, blotter, with filters, filesystem...

LOW PRIORITY:

    FFI per dongle dll

    mongo authentication

    is vcredist needed ?

FUTURE:

    jruby?

    correlation hooks
