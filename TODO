    differentiate between input/output connectors:

        - xml format
        - implement transport layers:
        - proprietary for read-only db
        - sftp


TODO FUTURE:

    correlation:
        chat peer not as string but array

======================================

    mongo authentication

    upgrade to mongoid 3.0.x

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)
      - factory (direct mongo query)
      - operation (direct mongo query)
      - search (direct mongo query)
      - target (direct mongo query, move has too much logic)
