TODO:  9.2.x

  IMPLEMENT:

    new protocol for anonymizers (alor & fabio)
      - NC will remain only for retro-comp and to upgrade to new anons
      - anon -> collector status reporting
      - collector -> anons configuration

    PUSH messages send the whole object (like dashboard)

    fix usb building zip creation (uses too much ram in f.read)

    thumbnails for screenshots (and camera)           [ok]
      - avoid imagemagik under windows if possible    [nope]
      - direct embed in evidence or gridfs?           [ok]
      - update export utility to skip the thumbnails  [ok]

    filter links by type (e.g. I want to see only skype links). We can change the format of the info attribute..

TODO: 9.3.0

    Use Mongodb 2.6.x

    Mongoid refactoring
      - check if mongoid 4 is stable
      - migrate to mongoid 4
      - check if the connection pooling helps resolving the "get_stucked" problem

    archive mode able to receive from multiple systems

    automatic discovery (and thus suggestion) of groups (communities)
    calculate "centrality" on entities
    calculate "weight" on entities

======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    message quque on entities
      - sort of "inbox" for each entity on what the system performs on it
        the customer can review the messages and acknowledge them

    advanced multi operation search

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)

======================================
