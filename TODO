TODO 9.0.0

  IMPLEMENT:

    dashboard in push mode

    winphone certificate

  FIX:
    change entity#flow result format + speed up

  TRY:
    hash index for sharding (topac - on branch 9.0.x)
    caching slow query. try to cache already jsonized list of items and similar

TODO 9.1.x

  IMPLEMENT:

    create as target (from automatic entities)

    scout++ (with simplified config)

    ability to group entities together (better visualization)

    statistic analyzer (alor)
      automatic detection of home / office (needs timezone for each entity)
      frequencer for places

  IDEAS:
    message quque on entities
      - sort of "inbox" for each entity on what the system performs on it
        the customer can review the messages and acknowledge them

    placeholder targets (linked from other operations)

    intra operation correlation (visualize like a link to a group that actually is the other operation)

    advanced multi operation search

======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)

======================================
IDEAS:

    global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)
