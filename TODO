TODO 9.0.0

  IMPLEMENT:
    statistic analyzer (alor)
      automatic detection of home / office (needs timezone for each entity)
      frequencer for places

    keep same id for grid objects during connectors sync

    method to send coordinates for the position player in console [OK]

    entities in the recent item list (must modify the structure of recents)

    dashboard in push mode
      - only after the dashboard as been refactored, issue a target|operation.restat on each target|operation.show

  MIGRATION:
    migrate old position to the new 2dsphere index
    migrate old connector to new format

  FIX:
    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)
    try to implement "retry" on mongoid queries
    rest/sync#store_evidence: how to store the grid file with a custom id?

  TEST:
    flow integration with console


  TRY:
    hash index for sharding (topac - on branch 9.0.x)
    caching slow query. try to cache already jsonized list of items and similar

======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)

======================================
IDEAS:

    global target position (http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-data-retention)
