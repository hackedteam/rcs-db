TEST:
    performance
        to_json is INSANELY SLOW

    create an item, use it in recent, dashboard, alert and nia rules, then delete it and check accordingly

    injector rules pushing

    create an agent, sync, delete it and check the evidence destroy process (should drop evidences and gridfs)

HIGH PRIORITY:

    distributed workers, same as shards (daniele)
    	- geolocation (the resolution is already on REST on the db)

    dont' send config to backdoor too old

    check the TODOs in the code...

    anonymizer configuration

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

    complete the audio decoding (daniele)

    get_accessible should be faster

    Forwarder (worker)

    sms wap send

    export logs: all, blotter, with filters, filesystem...

LOW PRIORITY:

    FFI per dongle dll

    mongo authentication

    is vcredist needed ?

    bundle config build.mysql2 --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt
    gem install mysql2 --platform=ruby -- --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt

FUTURE:

    jruby?

    correlation hooks
