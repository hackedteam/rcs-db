  * fix pushmanager#notify and place :user_id directly in the message field [OK]
  * run tests on *-release folders (if any)

  FIX:
    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)
    try to implement "retry" on mongoid queries

  IMPLEMENT:
    statistic analyzer (alor)
      automatic detection of home / office (needs timezone for each entity)

    refactor the connectors to use queue and export from separate process [OK]
      - xml export [OK]
      - sync with "archive" rcs installation

    most visited places

    method to send coordinates for the position player in console

    entities in the recent item list (must modify the structure of recents)

    dashboard in push mode
      - only after the dashboard as been refactored, issue a target|operation.restat on each target|operation.show

    on backup restore -> restat everything!!!


  TEST:
    flow integration with console

  MIGRATION:
    migrate old position to the new 2dsphere index

  TRY:
    hash index for sharding (topac - on branch 9.0.x)
    caching slow query. try to cache already jsonized list of items and similar

======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)

======================================
