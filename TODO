TODO 9.2.x

  TRY:
    caching slow query. try to cache already jsonized list of items and similar

  IMPLEMENT:

    soldier building (with simplified config)

    support for exploit pack file with VPS address (serving only exploits)

    class to manipulate the windows firewall

    create as target (from automatic entities) [OK] (needs button in console)
    export to connector [OK] (needs some config from the console...)

    NSIS for silent installation

    crypto-currency dissector
      - implement the evidence format
      - dissector in sbdb [ok]
      - check compilation under windows [ok]
      - remove temporary files __db*

    tests for all the builds of different platforms (win, osx, android...)
      - build every kind of method (silent, scout, melted, cooked, wap, qrcode...)
      - test the upgrade process (check that files are put in queue)
      - create a new rake spec:build:all and aliases for spec:build:platform [ok]

    protect the code of the rcs-common gem (include the rgloader dir in the gem)

TODO FUTURE:

    automatic discovery (and thus suggestion) of groups (communities)

    map api request statistics

    better investigation on "end of file reached" errors from mongoid (hoping for version 4.0.0 with connection pool)

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)

    message quque on entities
      - sort of "inbox" for each entity on what the system performs on it
        the customer can review the messages and acknowledge them

    advanced multi operation search

    Refactor evidence search filters (Evidence#common_filter, etc.)

    RUBY 2.0.0 ON WINDOWS depends on this:
      - http_parsers 0.5.3 needs this file https://github.com/johanneswuerbach/http_parser.rb_2.0_precompiled
      - check if new version has it
      - check that websocket dependencies have the correct version
