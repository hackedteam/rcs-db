TODO 9.0.0

    upgrade to ruby 1.9.3-p392 on windows

    --

  FIX:
    check "end of file reaced" from mongoid
    try to implement "retry" on mongoid queries
    check threads waiting on queued collection (alert, push)

  IMPLEMENT:
    aggregates for places (alor)
      - refactor aggregates to support spatial indexes
      - search for similar point in aggregates

    export entities data (topac)

    api for console to display communication flows (message, call, chat)

    export graph data

    refactor the connectors to use queue and export from separate process
      - xml export
      - sync with "archive" rcs installation

  TRY:
    hash index for sharding (topac - on branch 9.0.x)



======================================
TODO FUTURE:

    Refactoring on rest methods:
      - agent (too much logic here)
      - evidence (too much logic here)
