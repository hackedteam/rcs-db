HIGH PRIORITY:

    PERFORMANCE TEST !!!!

    sync / async file transfers !!!  (daniele)
        - even from the public on the collector (daniele)

    distributed workers, same as shards (daniele)
        - mongos should be accessible by all the workers (alor)
        - modify the NSIS to install the worker together with the shards (alor)

    connect the build process with tasks ( together )

    create cooker for NIA

    evidence grid methods

    remove objects that references an item on deletion (rules, alerts, dashboard, recent)  (alor)
    
    to_json is INSANELY SLOW

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

    complete the worker decoding (daniele)
	- audio
	- geolocation

    rename proxy -> injector

    Crawler for geo
    
    Alerting daemon (worker)

    Forwarder (worker)

    Blotter (browsing like console)
    export logs

LOW PRIORITY:

    get time via http (collector)

    dongle dll 

    rubyencoder for 1.9.3 does NOT exist yet... :(

    mongo authentication

    regsrv32 capicom.dll  (or run ruby as system)

    bundle config build.mysql2 --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt
    gem install mysql2 --platform=ruby -- --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt

FUTURE:

    jruby?

    correlation hooks
