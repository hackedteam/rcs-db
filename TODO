TEST:
    performance
        to_json is INSANELY SLOW

    create an item, use it in recent, dashboard, alert and nia rules, then delete it and check accordingly

    injector rules pushing

HIGH PRIORITY:

    distributed workers, same as shards (daniele)
    	- geolocation (the resolution is already on REST on the db)

    default upload on new instances

    check the TODOs in the code...

    ask for confirmation (data deletion) on uninstall (alor)


MEDIUM PRIORITY:

    complete the audio decoding (daniele)

    anonymizer configuration

    get_accessible should be faster

    Forwarder (worker)

    export logs: all, blotter, with filters, filesystem...

LOW PRIORITY:

    FFI per dongle dll

    sms wap send

    mongo authentication

    is vcredist needed ?

    bundle config build.mysql2 --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt
    gem install mysql2 --platform=ruby -- --with-mysql-dir=c:\mysql --with-mysql-lib=c:\mysql\lib\opt

FUTURE:

    jruby?

    correlation hooks
